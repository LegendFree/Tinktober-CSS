Make changes based on what component you are adding. for example If you have a button component copy the below html code into button.html and add your component inside this html and write your css inside button.css file:

```html
<!--          (you can specify your name here)   -->
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-lg-6">
    <div class="component">
      <div class="card magictime">

        <!-- Here Philip is the css selector for changing card color, write your name in the place of philip-->

        <div class="card-title philip">
          <strong>Button</strong>
        </div>
        <div class="card-content">

          <!-- Add your html code for your component inside this. -->

        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="col-lg-6">
    <div class="component">
      <div class="card magictime">

        <!-- Here Philip is the css selector for changing card color-->

        <div class="card-title philip">
          <strong>Creator</strong>
        </div>
        <div class="card-content">
          <div class="creater-name">
            <h2>
              <b>Name:</b
              ><span>

              <!-- Add your name and github profile link.  -->

              <a href="profile link">your name </a>
              </span>
            </h2>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```
