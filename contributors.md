# css-components contribution guidelinesðŸ˜¬

After cloning this repo open the project folder in a _text-editor_(vs code is preferable). If you don't have vs-code in your machine, [install it](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

## Folder Structure

```
â”œâ”€â”€â”€css
â”‚   â””â”€â”€â”€assets
â”œâ”€â”€â”€favicon
â”œâ”€â”€â”€images
â”œâ”€â”€â”€js
â””â”€â”€â”€pages

```

The **css** folder contains all the files for adding your `css` and the **pages** folder contains the `html` files for adding html code.

## Make necessary changes and commit those changes

Make changes based on what component you are adding. for example If you have a button component copy the below html code into button.html and add your component inside this html and write your css inside button.css file:

```html
<!--          (you can specify your name here)   -->
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-lg-6">
    <div class="component">
      <div class="card magictime">
        
        <!-- Here Philip is the css selector for changing card color, write your name in the place of philip-->
        
        <div class="card-title philip">
          <strong>Button</strong>
        </div>
        <div class="card-content">
         
          <!-- Add your html code for your component inside this. -->
        
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="col-lg-6">
    <div class="component">
      <div class="card magictime">
        
        <!-- Here Philip is the css selector for changing card color-->
        
        <div class="card-title philip">
          <strong>Creator</strong>
        </div>
        <div class="card-content">
          <div class="creater-name">
            <h2>
              <b>Name:</b
              ><span>
                
              <!-- Add your name and github profile link.  -->
              
              <a href="profile link">your name </a>
              </span>
            </h2>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

# Changing card color

You can change your card color by adding your name as a `selector`(in the above example `philip` is the selector). After adding your name as selector you can change its color by editing the file cardcolor.css like this:

```css
/* You can add your name  */
.your-name {
  background-color: #5f067b;
}
```

## commit these changes

Add those changes to the branch you just created using the `git add` command:

```

```

Now commit those changes using the `git commit` command:

```
git commit -m "Added new <Your component name>"
```

## Push changes to github

Push your changes using the command `git push`:

```

```

replacing `<add-your-branch-name>` with the name of the branch you created earlier.
